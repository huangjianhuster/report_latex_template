  abstract = {Motile bacteria sense their physical and chemical environment through highly cooperative, ordered arrays of chemoreceptors. These signalling complexes phosphorylate a response regulator which in turn governs flagellar motor reversals, driving cells towards favourable environments. The structural changes that translate chemoeffector binding into the appropriate kinase output are not known. Here, we apply high-resolution electron cryotomography to visualize mutant chemoreceptor signalling arrays in well-defined kinase activity states. The arrays were well ordered in all signalling states, with no discernible differences in receptor conformation at 2--3 nm resolution. Differences were observed, however, in a keel-like density that we identify here as CheA kinase domains P1 and P2, the phosphorylation site domain and the binding domain for response regulator target proteins. Mutant receptor arrays with high kinase activities all exhibited small keels and high proteolysis susceptibility, indicative of mobile P1 and P2 domains. In contrast, arrays in kinase-off signalling states exhibited a range of keel sizes. These findings confirm that chemoreceptor arrays do not undergo large structural changes during signalling, and suggest instead that kinase activity is modulated at least in part by changes in the mobility of key domains.},

We engineered chemoreceptor cytoplasmic regions to assume a trimer of receptor dimers configuration that formed well-defined complexes with CheA and CheW and promoted a CheA kinase-off state. These mimics of core signaling units were assembled to homogeneity and investigated by site-directed spin-labeling with pulse-dipolar electron-spin resonance spectroscopy (PDS), small-angle x-ray scattering, targeted protein cross-linking, and cryo--electron microscopy. The kinase-off state was especially stable, had relatively low domain mobility, and associated the histidine substrate and docking domains with the kinase core, thus preventing catalytic activity. Together, these data provide an experimentally restrained model for the inhibited state of the core signaling unit and suggest that chemoreceptors indirectly sequester the kinase and substrate domains to limit histidine autophosphorylation.},

  abstract = {Membrane-associated proteins are important because they mediate interactions between a cell's external and internal environment and they are often targets of therapeutics. Characterizing their structures and binding interactions, however, is challenging because they typically must be solubilized using artificial membrane systems that can make measurements difficult. Mass spectrometry (MS) is emerging as a valuable tool for studying membrane-associated proteins, and covalent labeling MS has unique potential to provide higher order structure and binding information for these proteins in complicated membrane systems. Here, we demonstrate that diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) can be effectively used as a labeling reagent to characterize the binding interactions between a membrane-associated protein and its binding partners in an artificial membrane system. Using chemotaxis histidine kinase (CheA) as a model system, we demonstrate that DEPC-based covalent labeling MS can provide structural and binding information about the ternary complex of CheA with two other proteins that is consistent with structural models of this membrane-associated chemoreceptor system. Despite the moderate hydrophobicity of DEPC, we find that its reactivity with proteins is not substantially influenced by the presence of the artificial membranes. However, correct structural information for this multiprotein chemoreceptor system requires measurements of DEPC labeling at multiple reagent concentrations to enable an accurate comparison between CheA and its ternary complex in the chemoreceptor system. In addition to providing structural information that is consistent with the model of this complex system, the labeling data supplements structural information that is not sufficiently refined in the chemoreceptor model.},
